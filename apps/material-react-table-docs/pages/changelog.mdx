## MRT V3 Changelog

### Version 3.0.3 - 2024-12-13

- Fixed filter text field value

### Version 3.0.2 - 2024-12-08

- Fixed rendering of multi-select filter when filter value is an empty array
- Rearranged execution of `muiTableBodyCellProps?.onKeyDown` internally to allow these events to be overridden or even skipped
- Fixed MRT_RowActionMenu key prop internally
- Corrected Sweedish `sv` locale translations
- Removed 'new-password' from autocomplete in text fields and just use 'off'

### Version 3.0.1 - 2024-09-05

- Removed fullscreen MUI FocusTrap wrapper for now since vitest had issues with it

### Version 3.0.0 - 2024-09-05

- `@mui/material` and `@mui/icons-material` v6.0.0 are now minimum required versions of Material UI packages (you might be able to get away with lower MUI versions for a while, but eventually MUI V6 APIs will be used internally by MRT and your project will break)
- `@mui/x-date-pickers` v7.15.0 is now a minimum required dependency
- `react` and `react-dom` v18.0.0 are now a minimum required dependencies (some React 18 APIs are now used internally by MRT)
- Keyboard navigation for table cells in now enabled by default. If you had added your own custom keyboard shortcuts, you may want to set `enableKeyboardShortcuts` to `false` or remove your custom shortcuts.
- Removed deprecated `MRT_Virtualizer` type in favor of separate `MRT_RowVirtualizer` and `MRT_ColumnVirtualizer` types
- Removed deprecated `text` in favor of the more consistent `label` type in dropdown/autocomplete/select option types.
- Deprecated several `mui*Props` table options that were column-specific. These table options should either be specified in column defs or in the `defaultColumn` table option.
  - `muiColumnActionsButtonProps`
  - `muiColumnDragHandleProps`
  - `muiCopyButtonProps`
  - `muiEditTextFieldProps`
  - `muiFilterAutocompleteProps`
  - `muiFilterCheckboxProps`
  - `muiFilterDatePickerProps`
  - `muiFilterDateTimePickerProps`
  - `muiFilterSliderProps`
  - `muiFilterTextFieldProps`
  - `muiFilterTimePickerProps`
  - `muiTableBodyCellProps`
  - `muiTableHeadCellProps`
  - `muiTableFooterCellProps`
  - `renderCellActionMenuItems`
  - `renderColumnActionsMenuItems`
  - `renderColumnFilterModeMenuItems`
- Fixed top pagination and searchbox sometimes overlapping
